The data spans the months of 2007 and includes a total for the year. The data is aggregated to Postal Areas (POAs) from the 2016 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).<br/><br/>\n\nEvery month the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) publishes small-scale renewable energy installation data files. These data files provide a list of small generation units (SGU) (small-scale solar panel, wind and hydro systems) and kW capacity by installed postcode, and SWH and air source heat pumps by installed postcode. The data represents all systems that have had certificates validly created against them. The data includes new installations, upgrades to existing systems and stand-alone (off-grid) systems. This data is not publicly available via the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Registry and does not include systems that are pending registration or have been failed by the CER.<br/><br/>\n\nFor further information about this dataset, visit the data source:\n<a href=\"http://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/RET/Forms-and-resources/Postcode-data-for-small-scale-installations\" target=\"_blank\">Clean Energy Regulator - Postcode Data for Small-scale Installations</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note:\n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data by joining the data with the <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.003~July%202016~Main%20Features~Postal%20Areas%20(POA)~8\" target=\"_blank\">2016 ASGS POAs</a></li>\n<li>The data is current as at 30-09-2018.</li>\n<li>Renewable Energy Target (RET) legislation allows a 12 month creation period for registered persons to create their certificates.</li>\n<li>Small-scale technology certificates are calculated based on the life of the system.
